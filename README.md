I am still looking for the code I used for this, but I think i can easily enough recreate it.
The TAs in my C programming class could not explain/show it so eventually I got to grad school (Post GXPN) and I had to create a DEP evading stack based bufferoverflow.... I created a pptx for this effort to use to help train the next generation version of myself who was curious about this but did not have the means to get there yet.
